this will be a documentation for robot prototypes
RED (rough entry droid)
plans for red: 

### ü§ñ Companion & Personal Assistant Robot
- **Talk with you naturally** (like JARVIS!)
- **Remind you** of tasks, events, or appointments
- **Control smart home devices** (lights, speakers, etc.)
- **Answer questions** using AI (weather, facts, help with homework)
- **Play music** or read out news
- **Tell jokes**, play games, or be a little buddy

### üè† Home Utility Robot
- Use sensors (like temperature, motion, or light) to:
  - Alert you if doors are left open
  - Turn lights on/off automatically
  - Detect someone entering a room and greet them
- Monitor your room or house and report back (basic security)

### üí¨ Social AI Robot
- Learn how different people interact with it (like your affection system)
- Adapt tone/mood based on interactions
- Be used in schools, nursing homes, or hospitals for companionship
- React emotionally or conversationally in fun or empathetic ways

### üß† Educational Tool
- Teach others how AI works (voice recognition, affection tracking, etc.)
- Help kids or students learn programming and robotics
- Be part of a science fair or tech competition

### ü§ù Custom Use Cases
- Voice-controlled robot for people with disabilities
- In a store or office as a greeter or info assistant
- Record voice logs or messages

      
PURPL(programmable utility robotic prototype for learning)
plan for purple:
  
### ü§ù 1. **Interaction-Focused Robot (Social Companion+)**
- **Facial recognition** to remember who's speaking
- **Facial expressions** using a screen or servo-driven face
- **Emotion simulation** (mood shifts, energy levels)
- **Dancing or gestures** to react to events
- Play games like 20 questions, trivia, or storytelling


### üõ†Ô∏è 2. **Utility or Task Robot**
- **Object detection and pickup** (grabber/claw + camera/sensor)
- **Follow-me mode** (using a camera or ultrasonic sensors)
- **Room patrol or mapping** (with a lidar or IR sensor)
- **Fetch items** in the house (low weight like remote or notes)
- **Clean-up bot** (push objects into a pile or use a vacuum base)

### üì° 3. **Connected Robot**
- **Connects to your phone** (via app or Bluetooth)
- **Monitors security cameras**
- **Controls other smart devices** (with API or home assistant integration)
- Sends you alerts or videos

### üí° 4. **Learning AI / Experiment Robot**
- **Self-learning conversations** (better responses over time)
- **Builds a profile for each person it talks to**
- Uses **machine learning** for image or object recognition
- **Trainable behavior** ‚Äì you teach it actions with voice commands

### üîã Bonus: Ideas for Both Robots Together
- One can be the **‚Äúbrain‚Äù** (AI + chat) and the other the **‚Äúbody‚Äù** (tasks + movement)
- They can **talk to each other** or even role-play
- One can give the other tasks (‚ÄúRobot 2, go check the door.‚Äù)


GRAY (general robotic assistant for you)

### üåê 1. **Explorer / Environment Mapper**
This one could autonomously explore and gather data:
- **SLAM mapping** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using lidar or ultrasonic sensors
- **Obstacle avoidance** with infrared or camera-based vision
- **Send back floor plans or room layouts**
- Explore outdoors or dangerous spaces (attics, basements, etc.)
- **Scout bot** for unknown areas

### üß† 2. **Emotion-Responsive Robot**
Takes the social side further:
- **Reads facial expressions or tone of voice**
- Adjusts behavior based on emotional cues
- Could play calming music, give pep talks, or even mirror your mood
- Becomes more empathetic or intuitive with experience

### üïπÔ∏è 3. **Gaming or Entertainment Bot**
- Plays games with you (voice-based, trivia, physical games like follow-the-light)
- Has a **LED screen face** or speaker system
- Can act out **storylines** or pretend to be characters
- Syncs with music and **dances**, changes light patterns

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. **Tool-Bot / Mini Lab Assistant**
- Holds or passes tools (magnetic arm or compartments)
- Alerts you if you leave something on for too long (like soldering iron)
- Can take notes via speech-to-text
- Works as a **development buddy**, giving tips or tracking your progress

### üîê 5. **Security + Privacy Bot**
- **Watch for intruders** or movement
- Alert you via phone or speaker
- Lock/unlock basic latches (mechanical arm)
- Recognize faces of known people
- Record short clips or take photos on command

### ü§ñ 6. **Meta-Bot (Robot that Manages Robots)**
- Coordinates tasks between Robot 1 & 2
- You talk to this one and it delegates: ‚ÄúTell Robot 2 to go to the door‚Äù
- Think of it as a mini **robotic manager** or central intelligence
- Could even run diagnostics on other bots or suggest upgrades



























names are based on the colour wheel and overlaping functions will result in combined colours eg: yellow + blue = green
primary secondary and tertiary
final robot will be white and perform all the functions that the previous robots can
